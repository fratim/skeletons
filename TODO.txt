TODO:
6. Pad blocks on edges to have them all the same size
8. Update meta gridsize - need to update indexing of synapses also
10. Initialize maps with specific size?
11. Make variables const if possible
12. Project synapses on surface
13. change pointclouds back to char (currently short)
14. Check blocksizes also for read write of border anchor points
15. Revive timing
16. fix writing of anchor points (how to write to the Block variable in a smart way?)
17. How to copy the base object variables to the inherited class object?
18, make block indices one object

COMMENTS:
1. Do we have a second monitor anywhere?
2. Name specifications:
    - input labels: labels_inp
    - segment: point cloud of one ID in a blocks
    - segment_ID: ID of the pointcloud (label)
    - Pointclouds: pointclouds (2D map)

IDEAS:
1. Generate 2nd LUT for border component configurations and mark border components
   in advance (then check both LUT on iteration step)
2. Can we somehow tweak the bitwise comparison and get rid ogf the extra bordercomponent sets by simply changing the labels?
3. Remove the removed surface points from the border points sets to achieve speed up

QUESTIONS:
1.
