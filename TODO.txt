TODO:
10. Initialize maps with specific size?
15. Revive timing
22. Change how anchor points are saved, to not have to pass block reference to segment
26. Dynamically allocate large objects
33. Read in / pass downsample factor of somae data
34. Write script to have all projected synapses in one file
35. Accelerate the adding of somae pixels (so far checking all 512 points (8**2))

COMMENTS:
2. Name specifications:
    - input labels: labels_inp
    - segment: point cloud of one ID in a blocks
    - segment_ID: ID of the pointcloud (label)
    - Pointclouds: pointclouds (2D map)

IDEAS:
1. Generate 2nd LUT for border component configurations and mark border components
   in advance (then check both LUT on iteration step)

QUESTIONS:
1. How to handle synapses that cannot be mapped?
2. Should we have a max distance to map synapses?
