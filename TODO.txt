TODO:
10. Initialize maps with specific size?
15. Revive timing
22. Change how anchor points are saved, to not have to pass block reference to segment
26. Dynamically allocate large objects
33. Read in / pass downsample factor of somae data
35. Accelerate the adding of somae pixels - new ideas?
36. make sure thinnig on surfaces is correct, check all 6 directions
Ask alex about gaps in proofread computation
Ask donglai about gt somae
Ask alex about brain connectome data

COMMENTS:
2. Name specifications:
    - input labels: labels_inp
    - segment: point cloud of one ID in a blocks
    - segment_ID: ID of the pointcloud (label)
    - Pointclouds: pointclouds (2D map)

IDEAS:
1. Generate 2nd LUT for border component configurations and mark border components
   in advance (then check both LUT on iteration step)
2. Place somae detection before read in of labels to speed up
3. http://www.bmva.org/bmvc/2013/Papers/paper0032/paper0032.pdf
QUESTIONS:
1. How to handle synapses that cannot be mapped?
2. Should we have a max distance to map synapses?
