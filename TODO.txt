TODO:
6. Pad blocks on edges to have them all the same size
8. Update meta gridsize - need to update indexing of synapses also
10. Initialize maps with specific size?
11. Make variables const if possible
12. Project synapses on surface

COMMENTS:
1. Do we have a second monitor anywhere?
2. Name specifications:
    - input labels: labels_inp
    - segment: point cloud of one ID in a blocks
    - segment_ID: ID of the pointcloud (label)
    - Pointclouds: pointclouds (2D map)

IDEAS:
1. Generate 2nd LUT for border component configurations and mark border components
   in advance (then check both LUT on iteration step)
2. Can we somehow tweak the bitwise comparison and get rid ogf the extra bordercomponent sets by simply changing the labels?

QUESTIONS:
1. Mistake in source code? Line 585 cpp-thinning:
  if (fwrite(&iv, sizeof(long), 1, wfp) != 1) { fprintf(stderr, "Failed to write to %s\n", widths_filename); exit(-1); } should be wfp

1. Interesting Neurons:
