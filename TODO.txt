Questions:


TODO:
1. Implement VolumeSize and BlockSizeInp and BlockSizePadded
2. Move CppUpdateGridsize and CppUpdateResolution to cpp-wiring (currently cpp-thinning)
3. Decide on how to name, segments, input labels and so on
4. Always pass block of data as first argument, later the longs
5. Adjust meta file to store values that we discussed
6. Pad blocks on edges to have them all the same size

COMMENTS:
1. Do we have a second monitor anywhere?

IDEAS:
1. Generate 2nd LUT for border component configurations and mark biorder components
   in advance (then check both LUT on iteration step)
