Questions:

Does the input grid size change for different neurons? How is this defined?
Change input_grid_size from float to long
VolumeSize and BlockSizeInp and BlockSizePadded

I would move CppUpdateGridsize and CppUpdateResolution to cpp-wiring (currently cpp-thinning)

How to name segements and labels

block first then index/label
