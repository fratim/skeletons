TODO:
10. Initialize maps with specific size?
11. Make variables const if possible
15. Revive timing
19. Talk to guy who did somae detection
22. Change how anchor points are saved, to not have to pass block reference to segment
25. Implement checknumber at end of every written file, that has to be read last to check completeness
26. Dynamically allocate large objects
29. Update LUT path
30. Solve issue with global coordinates (so far unused)
31. Solve problem of not being able to immediately execute refinement step

COMMENTS:
2. Name specifications:
    - input labels: labels_inp
    - segment: point cloud of one ID in a blocks
    - segment_ID: ID of the pointcloud (label)
    - Pointclouds: pointclouds (2D map)
3. generated skeletons for first 8 blocks in 38.6 seconds

IDEAS:
1. Generate 2nd LUT for border component configurations and mark border components
   in advance (then check both LUT on iteration step)
