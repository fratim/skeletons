TODO:
10. Initialize maps with specific size?
11. Make variables const if possible
12. Project synapses on surface
14. Check blocksizes also for read write of border anchor points
15. Revive timing
19. Talk to guy who did somae detection
20. get rid off passing the prefix to many functions
21. Change anchor points and zmax points
22. Change how anchor points are saved, to not have to pass block reference to segment

COMMENTS:
2. Name specifications:
    - input labels: labels_inp
    - segment: point cloud of one ID in a blocks
    - segment_ID: ID of the pointcloud (label)
    - Pointclouds: pointclouds (2D map)

IDEAS:
1. Generate 2nd LUT for border component configurations and mark border components
   in advance (then check both LUT on iteration step)
2. Can we somehow tweak the bitwise comparison and get rid ogf the extra bordercomponent sets by simply changing the labels?
3. Remove the removed surface points from the border points sets to achieve speed up
